javac -cp IIDR_INSTALL_DIR/lib/ts.jar AlertFileHandler.java UETrace.java

### Installation and configuration
1- Copy the *.class files into IIDR_INSTALL_DIR/lib/user
2- Copy the alertfile.properties file to the instance "conf" directory or to any other place pointed by ALERT_PROP_FILE environment variable
